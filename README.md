# Gravitas
### What?
Gravitas is a 2D physics engine written in C++ inspired by reading the source of [Box2D]. Gravitas aims to reimplement most of the features of [Box2D-lite] with a few key additions including:
* Using C++11 and later features missing from the original [Box2D]
* Allow for multiple gravity sources
* Allow for gravity sources to be radial as well as orthogonal
* Provide an interface which reveals collision polygons

### Why?
To learn!
* More design
* More profiling
* More testing

### Do I expect anyone to ever read this?
No!
